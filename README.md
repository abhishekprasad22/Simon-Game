<b>Simon game</b>
<br>
It is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to recall and replicate sequences of lights and sounds. Originally released
by Milton Bradley (now a division of Hasbro) in 1978, the game consists of a circular device with four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and 
yellow), each associated with a specific tone.

The following repository contains the website adaptation of the Simon Game in which it contains four buttons "Green, Red, Yellow and Blue"

<b>How to Play:</b>
1. Start the Game: The game begins when the player presses any keyboard button. Then lights up one of the four colored buttons and plays the corresponding tone.
2. Repeat the Sequence: The player must press the same colored button to replicate the sequence. If successful, the device will add another color to the sequence.
3. Increasing Difficulty: With each successful replication, the sequence grows longer and more complex. The player must remember the entire sequence and input it correctly.
4. Mistakes: If the player presses the wrong button or fails to complete the sequence, the game emits a buzzer sound, and the game ends. The player can then start over to try and beat their previous score.
