<b>Simon game</b>
<br>
It is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to recall and replicate sequences of lights and sounds. Originally released
by Milton Bradley (now a division of Hasbro) in 1978, the game consists of a circular device with four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and 
yellow), each associated with a specific tone.
