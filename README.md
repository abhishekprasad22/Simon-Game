# Simon Game

It is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to recall and replicate sequences of lights and sounds. Originally released by Milton Bradley (now a division of Hasbro) in 1978, the game consists of a circular device with four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow), each associated with a specific tone.

The following repository contains the website adaptation of the Simon Game in which it contains four buttons: Green, Red, Yellow, and Blue.

## How to Play

- **Start the Game**: The game begins when the player presses any keyboard button. Then, one of the four colored buttons lights up and plays the corresponding tone.
- **Repeat the Sequence**: The player must press the same colored button to replicate the sequence. If successful, the device will add another color to the sequence.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: With each successful replication, the sequence grows longer and more complex. The player must remember the entire sequence and input it correctly.
- **Mistakes**: If the player presses the wrong button or fails to complete the sequence, the game emits a buzzer sound, and the game ends. The player can then start over to try and beat their previous score.
